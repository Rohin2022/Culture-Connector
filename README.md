# Culture-Connector

### Our Inspiration
- 47% of the world lives on less than $6.85 per day
- 84% live on less than $30 per day
- Two billion people in the world currently suffer from malnutrition as a result of not being able to afford sufficient food
- 
We recognize the **impact that poverty has on millions of people** worldwide, and we hope to **create opportunities** for the affected to **share their language and culture** as a means of financially supporting themselves. Many who are affected by poverty are trapped in a generational cycle of struggling to find employment, and CultureTogether aims to address this issue by allowing them to use their knowledge about their language and culture to earn revenue through teaching.

### What it Does
Welcome to CultureTogether, a platform that allows members of underprivileged communities around the globe to teach their language and culture to students online. Through our proprietary matching algorithm, every student will have a customized list of recommended teachers appear on their dashboard. These teachers will be able to provide students with one-on-one language lessons, cooking tutorials of native recipes, and real-time tours of cultural sights in their neighborhood. By providing individuals with the opportunity to become teachers, we hope to give them a reliable source of income and a meaningful way to share their culture. We believe that these lessons will also be valuable for the students, who will have a unique opportunity to learn about a culture in a way that can only be taught by natives.

### How we built it
Our process was split into five parts:
Designing the UI interface using Figma
Implementing the designs using ReactJS
Creating the Firebase Realtime Database to store the data
Connecting the database with the React frontend

### User Safety, Privacy, and Security
All data is stored using Firebase, which encrypts data in transit using HTTPS (Firebase)
Ensure a compassionate and open environment where users are assured a safe experience for all

### User Experience
Minimalist UI interface allows for simple and efficient communication between users
The websites simple UI allows for everyone to get involved and learn or teach

### Challenges we ran into
Due to various time constraints (exams, sports, etc.) we had limited time to work on the project, with additional time we could've further improved the UI
Designing a clean, simple UI interface and improving the user experience

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The potential impact that our solution could have
Creating a clean and simple UI

### What's next for CultureTogether
Creating a native app to supplement the website and improve user experience on mobile devices
Creating our own video streaming service
