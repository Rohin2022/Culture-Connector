# Culture-Connector

### Our Inspiration
- 47% of the world lives on less than $6.85 per day
- 84% live on less than $30 per day
- Two billion people in the world currently suffer from malnutrition as a result of not being able to afford sufficient food

We recognize the **impact that poverty has on millions of people** worldwide, and we hope to **create opportunities** for the affected to **share their language and culture** as a means of financially supporting themselves. Many who are affected by poverty are trapped in a generational cycle of struggling to find employment, and CultureTogether aims to address this issue by allowing them to use their knowledge about their language and culture to earn revenue through teaching.

### What it Does
Welcome to CultureTogether, a platform that allows members of **underprivileged communities around the globe** to teach their language and culture to students online. Through our **proprietary matching algorithm**, every student will have a customized list of recommended teachers appear on their dashboard. These teachers will be able to provide students with **one-on-one language lessons**, **cooking tutorials of native recipes**, and **real-time tours of cultural sights in their neighborhood**. By providing individuals with the opportunity to become teachers, we hope to give them a **reliable source of income** and a meaningful **way to share their culture**. These lessons will simultaneously benefit the students, who will have a unique opportunity to learn about a culture in a way that can only be taught by natives.

### How we built it
Our process was split into five parts:
- Designing the UI interface using Figma
- Implementing the designs using ReactJS
- Creating the Firebase Realtime Database to store the data
- Connecting the database with the React frontend

### User Safety, Privacy, and Security
- All data is stored using Firebase, which encrypts data in transit using HTTPS (Firebase)
- We seek to ensure a compassionate and open environment where users are assured a safe experience for all

### User Experience
- Minimalist UI interface allows for simple and efficient communication between users
- The websites simple UI allows for everyone to get involved and learn or teach

### Challenges we ran into
- Due to various time constraints (exams, sports, etc.) we had limited time to work on the project, with additional time we could've further improved the UI
- Creating an aesthetic UI that was still easy to use

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The impact that our solution could have
- Creating a clean and simple UI

### What's next for CultureTogether
- Creating a native app to supplement the website and improve user experience on mobile devices
- Creating our own video streaming service that is embedded within the website in order to simplify UX
- Implementing the money transfer system within the website
